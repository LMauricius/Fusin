# Fusin
(WIP) An input library oriented towards game development that combines many input sources under one API.
Its pure modular approach makes it easy to extend functionality without changing the library usage whatsoever.
The aim is to make it multiplatform, althought it currently only supports Windows via the Raw Input SubSystem.
